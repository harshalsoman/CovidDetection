# CovidDetection
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect COVID-19 infection from audio signals like cough and breath sounds. By preprocessing audio data and training the CNN model, it achieves an accuracy of 87.55% on the test set, providing a promising approach for non-invasive COVID-19 detection.
