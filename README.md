# COVID-19 Detection using Audio Signals
This project aims to detect COVID-19 infection by analyzing audio signals, such as cough and breath sounds. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the project processes and classifies audio data to identify potential COVID-19 cases.

### Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Audio data is preprocessed for optimal feature extraction and model training.
- Model Training: A CNN model is trained to classify audio signals into COVID-19 positive or negative categories.
- Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Results: The final model achieves an accuracy of 87.55% on the test set.

### Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/harshalsoman/CovidDetection.git

2. Accessing the Dataset

  The dataset is available publicly on IISc Bangalore's website. You can access and download it using the following link:
